# OS-Project

## All is made using inter-process communication (IPC)

## Made a small OS like that implements scheduling algorithms like
  * Round Robin
  * Highest Priority First
  * Shortest Remaining Time First
 
## And also added a memory management module that allows for processes to be added to system only if there is enough memory
  * Memory is allocated using buddy allocation algorithm
 
## Implemented the producer-consumer problem that supports several producers and several consumers on same shared memory block, made synchronization possible using semaphores
